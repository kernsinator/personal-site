For some reason (probably my begging for your feedback), you've found my personal site! This is just a quick run through of what this site is for, who I am, and what you can expect. 

## Who am I?

Batman. Next.

## Why make this website?

I started this site to document my knowledge as I build my web development portfolio. Even though I'm only at the start there are already a lot of things I'd like to write about to keep a record of my progress. Future employers will be able to clearly see the path I've taken. Other beginners could potentially get some value from me documenting obstacles and how I solved them. Maybe most importantly, I can look back at everything I've written.

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

## Section Header

Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.

```diff-js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
+	let counter = 0;
+	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
