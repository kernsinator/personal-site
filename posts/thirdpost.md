You'll hear that programming is 80% planning and 20% coding. The exact number may change depending on the source but the concept stays the same. Any significant, or even insignificant, project benefits from thorough planning. For beginners like me that is usually a challenge. To start, where do you even begin? What structures and models do you use to describe what you want to see on the screen? I had drawn up some pretty crude UML diagrams for classes in the past, but at the time I did not understand how valuable extensive planning is to a project. Luckily that has changed.

Here's a list of topics I did some research on during my search for the proper planning routine:

- Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- Wireframing
- Figma
- Photoshop

In some cases, much of the planning is abstracted away by the tools used. This site, for example, was built using an 11ty starter. Damn near everything I would have been stuck on was already planned and implemented by someone else. But I can guarantee that the person/people behind the starter and behind 11ty planned extensively. It would be impossible to bring so many moving pieces together otherwise. Django removes a lot of planning. Especially if you use Django ORM, really you just plan the models. Express, on the other hand, is much less opinionated. This means that you can take your project in whatever direction you choose. That can be a good thing, but it can also be a disaster without proper planning. The point here is that what your planning looks like can change from project to project. It probably SHOULD change if your strategies and tools are changing. But the concept and the routine stay the same.


Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.

```python
let iWantPizza = True;

if (iWantPizza) {
  console.log('Yes, I want pizza');
}
```

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.
